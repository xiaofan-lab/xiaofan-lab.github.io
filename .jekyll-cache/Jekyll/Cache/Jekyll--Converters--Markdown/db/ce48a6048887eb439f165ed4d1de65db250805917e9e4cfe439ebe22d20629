I"²<p>After obtaining his Bachelorâ€™s degree in Biochemistry in Nigeria, Joseph Tsenum completed two Masterâ€™s degrees in Applied Bioinformatics and Professional Bioinformatics from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT) and Georgia Institute of Technology, respectively. His Masterâ€™s thesis at MIPT was on leveraging deep learning architectures to predict DNA:RNA triplex structure formation by long non-coding RNAs. At Georgia Tech, he worked on time-series modeling, multimodal AI, and interpretable AI for different omics projects. Before joining Dr. Xiaoâ€™s lab to continue with his Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering (Modeling &amp; Biomedical Data Science Specialization) at UF, he took a shot in the industry as an AI Engineer at Genvor Incorporated, where he leveraged GenAI to design novel biologics. He is the Founder and CEO of Bio-PrecisionAI Health, a startup focused on leveraging GenAI technologies to design novel biologics and small drug molecules to treat human diseases in the multiomics era. He is also the Founder and Executive Director of New Life Research Foundation (NELIREF) Ltd/Gte, a Christian nonprofit based on bridging academic and industrial research.</p>
