<p>Background<br />
DNA sequencing is increasingly incorporated into the routine care of cancer patients, many of whom also carry inherited, moderate/high-penetrance variants associated with other diseases. Yet, the prevalence and consequence of such variants remain unclear.<br />
Methods<br />
We analyzed the germline genomes of 10,389 adult cancer cases in the TCGA cohort, identifying pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in autosomal-dominant genes, autosomal-recessive genes, and 59 medically actionable genes curated by the American College of Molecular Genetics (i.e., the ACMG 59 genes). We also analyzed variant- and gene-level expression consequences in carriers.<br />
Results<br />
The affected genes exhibited varying pan-ancestry and population-specific patterns, and overall, the European population showed the highest frequency of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants. We further identified genes showing expression consequence supporting variant functionality, including altered gene expression, allelic specific expression, and mis-splicing determined by a massively parallel splicing assay.<br />
Conclusions<br />
Our results demonstrate that expression-altering variants are found in a substantial fraction of cases and illustrate the yield of genomic risk assessments for a wide range of diseases across diverse populations.</p>
