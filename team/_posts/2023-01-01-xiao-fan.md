I am an Assistant Professor in [Biomedical Engineering](https://www.bme.ufl.edu/) at the [University of Florida](https://www.fredhutch.org/).

My research program seeks to improve understanding of genetic, biological and medical questions using computational approaches. The research projects include study of rare genetic diseases, interpretation of genetic variants, and characteristics of medical phenotypes. My laboratory aims to discover novel genes underlying diseases using case-control association studies, accurately identify pathogenic variants using machine learning methods, and predict trajectory of medical phenotypes based on cellular, molecular and genetic data.
