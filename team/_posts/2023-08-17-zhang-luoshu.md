Throughout my college life, I have been making sustained efforts to discover a genuine interest in my academic life. Challenging as the process may be, I persevered in my attempts to explore different research areas even when confronted with difficult situations. At the current stage, I am a doctoral student advised by Dr. Xiao Fan. My research topic is computational genomics.
