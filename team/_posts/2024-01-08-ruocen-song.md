I focus on the genetic basis of human diseases to use bioinformatics approaches and biological dataset, like DNA or mRNA, to find disease genes and develop more treatments in different diseases. I am more than eager to study more different tools to become a pioneering researcher and develop and create novel tools for biomedical engineering.
